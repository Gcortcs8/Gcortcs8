        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political ScienceðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I'm currently a 2nd year at UC Riverside and I really enjoy my time here as a student since I was able to meet new people, make friends, build connections and find myself in my short 2 years of attending this university. I am also working to be an orientation leader to help incoming students understand what it will be like being here at UCR and make their transition from high school to college a smooth one. 
        I am a first generation college student as both of my parents are from Mexico and never really pursued higher education which is why I am determined to succeed and become a lawyer that specializes in either criminal or immigration related cases. <br><br>

        I am from Cudahy, a small city in Los Angeles, California and I've lived there most of my life and I really love being a contributive member of society. I've been working at Lothian Dining Hall for about a year now and it's a humbling experience to say the least. You will learn communicative skills, time management skills and teamwork skills just as I have if you decide to work there. The student leads there are respectful and understanding and my coworkers are very nice and collaborative with any task assigned to us. My time working has been a drop in the ocean compared to the history of that dining hall as a whole. The residence hall actually had a fire back in 2014 and they decided to remodel the east side of the building which it's exterior/interior design is more modern that its west wing. Anywho, my business is selling jerseys for the National Mexican Football Team. There are dedicated fans throughout the United States which is why I decided to specialize in the sale of merchandise such as jerseys while in college as a sort of side hustle. That being said, Mexican fans are devoted supporters of this team, including myself, that demonstrates great pride in the country of our parents and family while living across the border in the United States. When Mexico won the 2023 Gold Cup, it inspired me to sell merchandise to capitalize on the dedicated fans because we tend to buy all jerseys released by Adidas since they have beautiful designs. It's a shame we didn't see the away jerseys during the 2022 World Cup because we didn't make it past the group stage. I sincerely hope anyone reading this finds an interest in starting a business together or just being moved to buy a Mexican jersey because they are very delightful pieces of clothing to own. Additionally, I am working with my advisors on the next possible step for this little company and we are considering a "buy 1, get 1 free" deal to entice people in purchasing our products because we are very generous individuals. To conclude, we believe that we will grow to become a valuable and reliable company in the near future and although this is a temporary business I am running, I believe that it will help me grow as a person in the end. Thank you for reading and email me if interested. Have a nice day!
